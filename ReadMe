This project is a simple automation test for the PHPTRAVELS Flight Search website.
The test opens the browser, goes to the flights page, enters the source city,
destination city, date of travel, and clicks the Search button.

The script is written in Java using Selenium and TestNG.
The browser is launched automatically and closes after the test is finished.

Project structure follows Page Object Model:
- HomePage: handles entering cities, date, and clicking search
- FlightsResultsPage: reads results after search
- BaseTest and DriverFactory: handle browser setup and closing
- FlightSearchTest: main test scenario
